> Java application on MVC architecture that compares and generates component recommendations based on a user's preferences

System that, based on the software used by a user, generates two recommendations:
1. Minimum: Minimum components for a given set of software
2. Recommended: Recommended components for a given software suite

In addition, the software also features hardware component comparison.
